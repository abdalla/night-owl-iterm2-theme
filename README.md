### Installation
Drag the file `themes/Night Owl.itermcolors` onto iTerm2, or import
it in *Preferences > Profiles > Colors*.

There is also a `Night Owl (inverse).itermcolors` theme, which swaps the
"normal"/"bright" colors; the default "normal" colors are the common foreground
colors used in the VS Code theme, but if for some reason your iTerm setup uses
the "bright" colors as foreground colors, you may use this inverse theme.

### Recommended iTerm2 Settings
- Preferences > Profiles > Text > Text Rendering
  - [ ] Draw bold text in bold font
  - [x] Draw bold text in bright colors
  - Use thin strokes for anti-aliased text: _On Retina Displays and Dark Backgrounds_

A VS Code theme for the night owls out there. Works well in the daytime, too, but this theme is fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. ‚ú®

## Separate the Editor from the Sidebar

This theme uses contrast sparingly so that when it's applied, it's more meaningful. This can help reduce noise and improve your ability to scan. However, some of the decisions may not work for everyone. One such decision that some disagree on is whether or not to have a separation between the editor and sidebar, and the amount of contrast. If you wish for this to have more visual signifigance, please paste this into your user settings preferences. These are my recommendations for these settings but you can use whatever colors you wish. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "activityBar.background": "#000C1D",
  "activityBar.border": "#102a44",
  "sideBar.background": "#001122",
  "sideBar.border": "#102a44",
  "sideBar.foreground": "#8BADC1"
},
```

## Preferences shown in the preview

The font in the preview image is Dank Mono, [available here](https://dank.sh/). Editor settings to activate font ligatures:

```
"editor.fontFamily": "Dank Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

The preview image is using [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer), a really cool extension that highlights matching brackets. This can help reduce unwanted errors.

I use this setting:

```
"bracketPairColorizer.forceIterationColorCycle": true,
```
